The Django admin page is a powerful, built-in interface for site administrators and developers to manage all the data and configuration of your web application.
Key Uses of the Django Admin Page
Data Management
View, add, edit, and delete any data in your database (users, medications, appointments, geofences, etc.).
Manage all models registered in admin.py without writing any code or SQL.
User Management
Create, edit, or delete user accounts (including superusers, caregivers, patients).
Reset passwords, assign roles, and manage permissions.
Content Moderation
Review and moderate user-generated content (e.g., chat logs, mood entries, SOS alerts).
Quick Prototyping and Debugging
Instantly inspect and modify data while developing or testing your app.
Useful for developers to verify that models and relationships are working as expected.
Permissions and Access Control
Assign staff status and permissions to users.
Control who can access the admin and what they can do.
Bulk Operations
Perform bulk edits or deletions on selected records.
Audit and History
Track changes to data (with extensions or customizations).
Why is it Separate from the Main UI?
Security: Only trusted staff/admins can access it.
Simplicity: Provides a generic, powerful interface for all models.
Customization: You can add filters, search, custom forms, and more for admin users.
