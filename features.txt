1. Django Web Framework
MVC/MVT Architecture: Django uses the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern, a variant of MVC, to separate concerns.

URL Routing: Clean URL mapping to views using Django’s urls.py.
App Modularization: The project is split into reusable apps (Accounts, Meds, Geofencing, Chat, etc.).

2. Database Management
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Django’s ORM abstracts SQL, allowing you to define models in Python and interact with the database using Python code.

Migrations: Schema changes are managed through migrations, ensuring database consistency.
Relational Database: Uses SQLite (or PostgreSQL) for persistent data storage.

3. User Authentication & Authorization
Custom User Model: Extends Django’s AbstractUser to support roles (patient, caregiver, admin) and additional fields (phone, etc.).

Authentication System: Login, logout, and registration handled securely.
Role-Based Access Control: Certain views and actions are restricted based on user roles.

4. Security
CSRF Protection: All forms use CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery.
Password Hashing: User passwords are securely hashed and never stored in plain text.
Login Required Decorator: Ensures only authenticated users can access sensitive views.

5. RESTful and Form-Based Views
Class-Based and Function-Based Views: Handles CRUD operations for medications, appointments, schedules, etc.

Form Validation: Server-side validation for all user input.

6. Asynchronous Tasks & Notifications
Celery Integration: For background tasks like sending medication reminders.
Twilio API: For sending SMS notifications (mocked in your setup).
Web Push Notifications: For browser/mobile reminders.

7. PDF Generation
WeasyPrint: Used to generate PDF reports of medication history.

8. Geofencing
Location Models: Stores geofence zones and SOS alerts.
Google Maps API: For geolocation and visualization (frontend, but data managed in backend).

9. Chatbot Integration
ChatterBot: AI-powered chatbot for user interaction and support.
Chat Message Logging: Stores chat history in the database.

10. Static and Media File Management
Static Files: CSS, JS, and images served via Django’s staticfiles system.
Media Files: (If used) for user-uploaded content.

11. Admin Interface
Django Admin: Powerful auto-generated admin for managing all models and data.

12. Error Handling & Feedback
Form Error Display: User-friendly error messages for invalid input.
404 and 500 Error Pages: Customizable error handling.

13. Internationalization & Timezone Support
i18n and Timezone: Django’s built-in support for multiple languages and timezones.

14. Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
Manifest & Service Worker: For offline support and installable web app experience.
